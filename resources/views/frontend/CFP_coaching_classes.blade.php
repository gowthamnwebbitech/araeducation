                    <p class="clr-000 marg-btm-20 comm-para txt-jus">CFP or Certified Financial Planner is a
                        qualification granted by the Financial Planning Standards Board (FPSB) to persons who intend
                        to take up financial planning as a career. Internationally recognized and regarded as the
                        finest in financial planning education, training, and ethics in practice is the CFP.
                        "Process of developing strategies to help people manage their financial affairs to meet life
                        goals" is how the FPSB describes financial planning. It entails assessing the client's
                        financial situation, creating a financial strategy specifically for them, and putting that
                        plan into action for their advantage.</p>

                        someone who makes decisions with your best interests at heart, is the most essential

                        advising services offer a wealth of job prospects for a Certified Financial Planner. A

                        financial planning services to businesses and individuals. Professionals who meet the
                        eligibility requirements and finish the 6-module CFP Certification Education Program are
                        eligible to receive the CFP certification. The CFP Syllabus supports the professional growth
                        of those with training in banking, investment planning, financial counseling, and related
                        areas. Financial planning, risk analysis, insurance planning, taxation, and estate planning
                        are among the primary subjects covered in CFP education.</p>
