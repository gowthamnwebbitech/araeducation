            <p class="content-text">All CA Final examinations will have 30% MCQs, much like the new CA Intermediate
                course 2024. Additionally, each
                incorrect objective response will receive a 0.25 negative marking.</p>
            <p class="content-text">The CA Final exemption regulations are identical to CA Intermediate.</p>
            <h5 class="content-title">Revised Exemption Criteria, 2024:</h5>
            <p class="content-text">A candidate is said to score exemption in any paper when he secures 60 or more
                marks in that respective paper. Such
                exemption will be valid for only 3 attempts that means the student has to qualify the other papers
                of that group in next
                3 attempts. The exemption can be availed subject to passing marks of 50% in each paper.</p>
            <h5 class="content-title">Revised CA Course Criteria, 2024:</h5>
            <p class="content-text">The concept of Accounting Technician Course (ATC) has been replaced by the
                Business Accounting Associate (BAA). Students
                who are unable to qualify the final stage may go for this option after fulfilling the prescribed
                criteria.</p>
            <h5 class="content-title">Practical Training Time Period | Duration</h5>
            <p class="content-text">Some relevant changes have been brought about in the Practical Training
                Structure under the Proposed
                Scheme. Such
                significant changes are as follows:</p>

            <p class="content-text">The length of the CA Articleship has been shortened by ICAI from three years to
                two years the fact
                that all CA
                applicants can now become CAs sooner than before is fantastic news for everyone.</p>

            <p class="content-text">However, there is a need for candidates who desire to become practitioners along
                with the shorter CA
                Articleship
                time.</p>

            <p class="content-text">Students who want to work as CAs must have one year of experience at a firm that
                specializes in
                chartered accounting.
                They will then be given a practice certificate.</p>

            <p class="content-text">Existing CAs will be considered to have met this requirement if they have spent
                one year working for
                a CA company in
                the previous five years. Aspirants who are looking for employment are not subject to this
                requirement.</p>

                assistants
