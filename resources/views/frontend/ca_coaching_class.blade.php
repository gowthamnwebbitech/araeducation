                <p class="content-box-text">In India, Chartered Accountants (CAs) are in high demand, with a wide
                    range of employment options ranging from
                    entrepreneurship to working in private businesses and government agencies. The capacity of
                    chartered accountants to
                    expand is also impacted by their ability to stay abreast of new and developing technology and
                    practices. A Chartered
                    Accountant, hold influential positions in the organizations and companies in the capacity of
                    filing business tax
                    returns, auditing business practices and financial statement and sometime offering services
                    involving financial advices
                    to the clients. It also depends upon the area of focus, for the firm or the organization.
                    Working in all sectors of the
                    economy, from public to private sectors, they provide their financial and strategic expertise
                    for the management of
                    business. Furthermore, for a variety of reasons, Chartered Accountants in India enjoy a sense of
                    work security and a
                    variety of prospects. In the private sector, the types of positions accessible for CAs are
                    mostly dictated by the
                    company type and location. Large corporations have more job openings in more sophisticated and

                    modules at their own pace and give online exams.</p>
                <p class="content-box-text">The self-paced modules are divided into four sets: Set A, Set B, Set C,
                    and Set D.</p>
                <p class="content-box-text">To become eligible for the CA Final exams, students have to clear these
                    4 sets. To clear these modules, they have to
                    score more than 50% marks in each module</p>

                <p class="content-box-text">According to the CA New Scheme 2024, students must pass both the CA
                    Intermediate group exams and the ICITSS training to
                    be qualified to begin the articleship training.</p>
                <p class="content-box-text">The change will be advantageous to the student because they can now
                    completely concentrate on their practical training

                <p class="content-box-text">Many students frequently lament the meagre pay they get for their CA
                    Articleship. ICAI has thus agreed to increase the
                    stipend by 100%. This change will be very much welcomed by the students, the stipend paid to
                    article assistants
                    presently will be doubled under the new scheme, i.e. 100% increment in the existing payment.</p>
