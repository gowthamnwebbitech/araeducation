                    <p class="clr-000 marg-btm-20 txt-jus"> One of the most well-known professions in the world is
                        law. In India, it is also one of the most promising career paths. As a result, a large
                        number of people in the nation seek legal degrees. There are several sorts of legal courses
                        in India, but in this post, we will discuss about the 5-year LLB course after 12th that may
                        be pursued by students after completing their Higher Secondary Certificate Education (Class
                        12). </p>

                    <p class="clr-000 marg-btm-20 txt-jus">A five-year LLB program combines the study of law with a
                        bachelor's degree in any field, including commerce, science, engineering, the
                        humanities, or the arts. The five-year law degree combines law courses with subjects
                        from other streams, in contrast to the three-year Bachelor of Law (LLB) degree, which is
                        focused on the fundamental legal disciplines. You can find out everything there is to
                        know about the five-year law degrees that are available in India in this page, including
                        the requirements for entrance and other information. </p>
